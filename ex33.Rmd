This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.






```{r}
concerts_obo <-
  jsonlite::fromJSON("https://cloud.culture.tw/frontsite/trans/SearchShowAction.do?method=doFindTypeJ&category=17", simplifyDataFrame = F)


```


```{r}
NewConcerts_obo <- concerts_obo

NewConcerts_obo[[3]]$showInfo[[1]][c("time", "location")] <-
  list(
    time = "2022/01/31 19:30:00",
    location = "Taichung Opera House"
  )
